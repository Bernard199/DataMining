## Part 1 and 2
  
For each selected feature, identify ALL the required data preprocessing methods like Normalization, Discretization, Binarization, and more based on the feature data properties. They must be done along with other preprocessing methods.  
  
### Examples of Lab1 Report of Data Preprocessing and Data Similarity Measures 
  
[Example1 of Lab1 Output: Part 1](https://eecs.csuohio.edu/~sschung/DSA460/Lab1_OutputExample_1.pdf)

> **Note:** that these Examples Here May NOT necessarily all correct ! They just show How Lab1 can be done as an example. Do NOT blindly follow !  
>For example, "EnglishEducation" should be Transformed as Categorical or Ordinal?
>If it is transformed as Categorical, One-hot-encoding is a correct transformation.
>However, if it is Ordinal, then one hot encoding is not a correct transformation for this column.



## Part 3 and 4
  
>**NOTE !!!**  
>You Are NOT Supposed to Use any Python Libs to Calculate Similarity Measures in Part 3 of Lab 1.  
>You have to write Scripts/Programs to Compute each Similarity Measure.  
>If you use the built-in lib to build a Similarity Measures, which is one line of code, you will get 0 for the part.
